In the contemporary era of mechanization, technological integration has become ubiquitous across various domains. While many tasks have transitioned from manual to automated processes, gardening remains an activity that often necessitates manual intervention. Our project aims to bridge this gap by presenting an innovative solution: the Smart Garden. This system enables users to automate gardening tasks, allowing for remote operation via smartphone integration. Leveraging Arduino as the primary platform, our design incorporates essential components such as soil moisture sensors, humidity sensors, temperature sensors, a DC water pump, an IR sensor for lighting, and a PIR sensor for motion detection. Our objective is to cultivate a user-friendly gardening experience, seamlessly blending automation with horticultural pursuits.
